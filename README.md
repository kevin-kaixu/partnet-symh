# The PartNet Symmetry Hierarchy Dataset (PartNet-Symh)

### Introduction

The **PartNet-Symh dataset** augments the **PartNet dataset** by adding a recursive hierarchical organization of fine-grained parts for each shape. The PartNet dataset was originally proposed in the paper "*PartNet: A Large-scale Benchmark for Fine-grained and Hierarchical Part-level 3D Object Understanding*". The hierarchical organization follows the symmetry hierarchy defined in [Wang et al. 2011]. The symmetry hierarchies were used to train the **PartNet model** proposed in our paper "*PartNet: A Recursive Part Decomposition Network for Fine-grained and Hierarchical Shape Segmentation*". In general, PartNet-Symh can be used to train any model for encoding/decoding part-based structures based on Recursive Neural Networks, e.g., GRASS [Li et al. 2017].

### Basic Information

The dataset contains *22369* 3D shapes covering *24* shape categories. See ***Table 1*** for the statistics of the dataset.

### Explaining the Dataset with an Example

Let us use a chair as an example to illustrate how our data is organized. We first show a figure to illustrate how to represent a part-based model with a symmetry hierarchy. We then explain the details of data organization.

#### 1. Symmetry hierarchy
![image](https://github.com/FENGGENYU/PartNet_symh/blob/master/symh.png) 
***Figure 1. A chair model is represented with a symmetry hierarchy which is a top-down recursive decomposition into its constituent parts.***

As shown in ***Figure 1***, a chair model is represented with a recursive symmetry hierarchy. Each leaf node represents a part. There are three types of nodes in the hierarchy: **Type 0 -- Leaf nodes** (e.g. *node 2*), **Type 1 -- Adjacency nodes** (e.g. *node 11*, indicating the proximity relations between two adjacent parts), and **Type 2 -- Symmetry nodes** (e.g. *node 9* or *node 12*, which represents either a reflectional or a rotational symmetry relations of multiple parts). A symmetry node stores the parameters (e.g., reflection axis) of the corresponding symmetry. Please refer to [Wang et al. 2011] and [Li et al. 2017] for more detailed definition of symmetry hierarchy.

We ensure all shapes belonging to the same shape category share the same high-level structure of symmetry hierarchy. This means that those shapes have consistency in the top few levels of their symmetry hierarchies [van Kaick et al. 2013]. These levels generally correspond to semantically meaningful major parts. For example, a chair model is composed of a back, a seat, a leg and an armrest, and the symmetry hierarchies are consistent at the level of these parts across all chairs.

#### 2. Data organization

There are seven folders for each model. 

##### A. The ops folder
Each mat file in this folder stores the corresponding types of the nodes of a symmetry hierarchy. Taking the symmetry hierarchy in  ***Figure 1 (b)*** for example, ***Table 2*** gives the node types in a [depth-first traversing order with vertex postorderings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search).

|  node  | *node 7*  | *node 3* | *node 4*    |  *node 11*   | *node 12*  | *node 13*  | *node 6* | *node 1* | *node 2* | *node 8* | *node 9* | *node 10* | *node 14* | *node 5* | *node 15* |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| type | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

***Table 2. Node type (0 -- leaf node, 1 -- adjacency node, and 2 -- symmetry node) of the nodes in Figure 1 (b).***


##### B. The part mesh indices folder
The mat file under this folder stores the part mesh indices corresponding to the leaf nodes of a symmetry hierarchy.
Taking the symmetry hierarchy in  ***Figure 1 (b)*** for example, ***Table 3*** gives the part mesh indices of leaf nodes in the same order as above.

|  leaf node  | *node 7*  | *node 3* |  *node 4* | *node 6* | *node 1* | *node 2* | *node 5* |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |---- |
| part mesh indices | 6 | 5 | 4 | 7 | 16 | 9 | 1 |

***Table 3. part mesh indices for leaf nodes.***


For example, you can find the sixth part mesh for ***node 7*** in 'objs' class from result_after_merging.json file for this shape. Note that this json file can be found in dataset from [[Mo et al 2019]](https://cs.stanford.edu/~kaichun/partnet/).

##### C. The boxes folder
The mat file under this folder stores the parameters of the part bounding boxes corresponding to the leaf nodes of a symmetry hierarchy.

##### D. The labels folder
The mat file under this folder stores the semantic label for each leaf node. ***Table 4*** gives the node labels of a chair model, *node 5* is the back part of the chair, labeled as 0. *node 7* is the seat, labeled as 1. *node 1*, *node 2* and *node 6* are the leg parts labeled as 2. *node 3* and *node 4* represent the armrests labeled as 3.  

|  node  | *node 7*  | *node 3* |  *node 4* | *node 6* | *node 1* | *node 2* | *node 5* |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| label | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |

***Table 4. Node labels (0 -- back, 1 -- seat, 2 -- leg, and 3 -- armrest).***


##### E. The syms folder
The mat file in the syms folder stores the symmetry parameters for each symmetry node. The symmetry labels are defined as: **0 -- reflected, -1 -- rotational, 1 -- translational**. Note that these definitions are slightly different from those of GRASS [Li et al. 2017]. Please use following code to read data.

##### F. The models folder
The models folder stores the 3D mesh models in .obj format.

##### G. The obbs folder
The obbs folder stores the whole shape obb for each model, which contains original part obb, adjacent part relations and symmetric parameters.
